Something interesting:
	- ELMO embeddings, Bert embeddings
	- F1 score as a loss function
	- Look into mislabellings (insight into F1 score)
	- Ensemble of models, majority voting
	- LSTM auto-encoder, model per class

In final paper, discuss:
	- Comparison between clean and dirty data
	- Discussion about 2-class and 3-class problem
	- Comparison between datasets, why were they good/bad?
	- LOTS OF TABLES/GRAPHS/FIGURES etc.



Schools
	- They are learning some Machine Learning now
	- Run my normal lesson, but make clear the potential of ML with cyberbullying
	- Write the letter, include what words a bully would use. Example sentences
