Final paper
	- show examples of racism, sexism, none
	- speak mostly about 2 class (for consistency of metric)
	- 1 page on 3-class but make the difference clear
	- Use the ML/DL graph in conclusion, we need more data
	- No-one would go out and collect Cyberbullying and hate-speech data, 18+


Project
	- Datasets:
		- DROP those with poor F1 (text messages and formspring)
		- KEEP 2-class, 3-class, Twitter1K and Dixon
	- ELMo on each dataset
	- Correlation between label and count of swear words for each dataset
	- Try GRU


Demo
	- Save pre-trained versions of best examples for each dataset
	- Ask Magnus (?) in the demo which model he would like to see
	- Print results
