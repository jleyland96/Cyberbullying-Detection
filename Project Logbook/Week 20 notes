Questions:
	- Include Reddit? Mention compromises.
	- Do Machine Learning and Deep Learning have capital letters?
	- Where should I put examples of racism, sexism, cyberbullying, neither?
	- What should I call my datasets?
	- How to approach my 0.930 state of the art value (since it's from the 3-class task)
	- MACRO F1?
	- Send draft midway through the holidays?


Notes:
	- Put link to GitHub code in solution section
	- Keep 3-class problem details until the end (as an expansion in results section).
	- Mention that this is research. Beating SOTA is not *too* important.
	- Examples of racism, sexism, cyberbullying, neither at literature review. Define + example in table
	- Reddit, Twitter_small, Twitter_big_2class, Twitter_big_3class.
	- All technical terms in italics
	- Include the dixon dataset stuff, but mention the compromises in the conclusion
	- Conclude whether it is worth investing time/effort/resources into DL instead of ML.



TODO on final paper:
	- Final Dixon results
